In other words, it is the proportion of all predictions that are correct. Accuracy is a useful indicator that our model performs well, but ignores the nuance that false positives and false negatives may have different costs associated with them. It also performs badly when there is a large class imbalance, which is a key consideration in the LFW dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "Which of these metrics is likely to be more useful? A key consideration here is what this algorithm is likely to be used for in the real world, and the implications of different errors. Precision is useful when the cost of false positives is high. A classic example is in disease detection algorithms, where a false positive could lead to expensive further tests and emotional trauma for the recipient. On the other hand, recall is useful when the cost of false negatives is high. For example, if we were sifting through CCTV images to spot a wanted criminal and a model ignored an image where the criminal was present, this would constitute a fundamental problem with the model. In our setting, where image recognition is being utilized in the entertainment sphere, the key outputs are likely to be in image labelling for news services and video annotation for live broadcast. Both services are primarily interested in making sure any allocated labels are correct - missing labels are less problematic than incorrect labels, especially for building public trust in the system and avoiding embarrassing errors, so the cost of false positives is likely to be higher. Thus, while we still consider recall for each predicted class, we primarily focus on precision in our model results."

        "## 4. a. Preliminary Model: Detecting Faces\n",
        "Any model concerned with classifying faces is posed with a preliminary problem: what is meant by a 'face'? This is obviously trivial for humans but identifying a face in an image is non-trivial for an image recognition algorithm. In the LFW data set, the data has been pre-processed to ensure that faces occupy a similar portion of each image, and that they are aligned consistently, with images rotated so the faces are square with the camera. Furthermore, the main CNN model we encode below considers the whole image, so implicitly recognises features of a face without us having to state where the face is. Thus, face detection is less important in this situation. However, in the real world - and particularly if we extend CNN analysis to videos - images are unlikely to be organised so helpfully, and this processing step is likely to be very important, hence its inclusion in this notebook. <br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we leverage previous work in the field. Facial detection is a well-researched area, and there are many potential methods to investigate and pre-trained models that perform well at identifying the region and features of a face. The model we focus on, MTCNN (Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) is optimised to identify the area of an image occupied by a face as well as the location of the eyes, nose, and mouth. The mechanics of this are detailed [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878). At a high level, the model leverages three distinct deep convolutional layers to target and model the features of a face, with the layers constructed in a way that specifically addresses the challenges associated with facial images such as inconsistent orientation, shadows or obstructions, and inconsistent shapes between e.g. an open and closed mouth. <br/>\n",

        "## 4. d. Classifying Faces: Advanced Models\n",
        "The above is a useful demonstration of how CNN techniques can be applied to the facial recognition problem, but basic CNN is the tip of the iceberg. There are a range of much more sophisticated CNN-based image recognition algorithms; we will focus on two. **Faster R-CNN** uses a Region Proposal Network to identify objects and a second CNN algorithm to classify images. Its leveraging of deep convolutional networks and intelligent proposal of candidate regions means the algorithm is generally highly accurate and runs faster than other R-CNN algorithms - more information is available [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, \"faster\" is a relative term - if we are interested in real-time allocation, which (as previously discussed) could be very important in real-world occasions, then **YOLO** (you only look once) could be a useful alternative. The above CNN model takes around 0.1 seconds to make a prediction on a new image, which may be too slow for real-world applications such as frame-by-frame live video annotation, for instance for a news channel. YOLO algorithms speed up this computational time. The strength of YOLO is that it only looks at each image once, treating detection as more of a regression problem and thus allowing for computational speeds that allow the model to be leveraged in real-time applications. It also looks at the entire image rather than focusing on the pixels containing the object, thus encoding more contextual information in the model - this can be useful if the model is applied to different scenarios, such as representations of an object in different media formats (e.g. a painting of the object). More information on the workings of YOLO is available [here](http://https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640v5.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "The third extension that might boost speed and accuracy is to leverage previous results, and there are two ways we could do this. The first way would be to explore **out-of-the-box facial recognition algorithms**, such as the [face_recognition](http://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) tool built using dlib's face recognition system - this package has an accuracy of 99.38% on the LFW dataset. We don't explore this technique here for two reasons: firstly, implementing pre-built packages is not useful for learning new computer vision techniques, and secondly, the package is unavailable in a Kaggle Kernel environment. The second way is to impose a **transfer learning** structure on the algorithm. Certain features occur many times between different images - for example, a convolution that identifies edges may be useful across a range of domains. If we could optimise our model weights using the output of other models, such as VGG16, then we would expect to see improvements in accuracy and computational times. This technique could work particularly well in conjunction with the Faster R-CNN approach."

        "On repeated runs of the George Bush model, we obtained a precision of around 81% and a recall of around 98%. In other words, 95% of the images we say are George Bush actually are George Bush, and 81% of the pictures of George Bush are identified as pictures George Bush. What does this mean in the real world?\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned in Section 3, precision is the metric we are most interested in, and the value of around 81% indicates that only 19% of the images we say are George Bush are in fact someone else. Is this acceptable? It is likely the answer is no. In news labelling, it is likely that there would be a human on hand to QA results before they reach the public, but in live video labelling these errors are likely to be too prevalent to be useful and could lead to embarrassing mistakes. A recall rate of somewhere around 99.5%+, or <$\\frac{5}{1000}$ errors of this nature, would give more confidence before committing this model to production. However, as discussed in Section 3, this very high recall value could give us confidence in applying this model to a different context where there is a high cost associated with false negatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "How does accuracy look in the 6-individual model? Precision and recall are of similar volume but vary more between classes. Indeed, in the final model run before publishing this notebook, precision averaged around 0.8\\* for all classes aside from one: the model's performance on Tony Blair images gave very low precision (0.41\\*), as many of the Tony Blair test images were mis-classified as images of George W Bush. For the same reason, recall was low for the George W Bush class. Rather than being a slightly dated piece of satire, this indicates the potential drawbacks of a shallow network trained on low data volumes when tasked with identifying individuals who have similar demographics and tend to appear in similar pictures. This problem could be addressed by adding more complexity to the model.\n",

        "# 6. Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
        "In this notebook, we have successfully run two CNN-based models using images from the LFW dataset: a two-class identifier that achieved precision of around 90% in 3 hours, and a six-class discriminator that achieved a similar precision in a much shorter time period (around 90 minutes) due to the lower data volumes. Thus, we have demonstrated that the CNN framework generalizes reasonably well to multiple classes, even when data volumes are relatively small, the CNN algorithm is simple, and the training time is low. However, there are several ways we could both improve the current model or extend to a different model that would likely bring higher accuracy and more reliable results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Model Improvements\n",
        "The best way to improve the model is by implementing more sophisticated model extensions. As discussed in Section 4d, there are two key routes for this method: YOLO, if rapid implementation is required, or Faster R-CNN with transfer learning, if optimal model accuracy is key. Based on previous results in the CNN literature, either of these methods should give strong improvements in speed and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the CNN infrastructure built in Section 4, there are several immediate improvements that we would make in future work, many of which are listed above: running for more epochs, on more classes, with more complex layers in the model. The first improvement would be in the model construction stage: the validation data is currently a single set, which with enough epochs can lead to overfitting on the validation data. Given the reasonable model performance on the test data, there doesn't seem to be a huge amount of overfitting, although it potentially manifests in the higher epochs of the six-class model. 10-fold cross validation would be preferable to a simple training/validation split.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important limitation around the model as it currently stands is its data input. As mentioned on the [LFW data source page](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/), there is large bias in the image selection around age, ethnicity and gender. Even after extending the model to encapsulate all the images, the utility of any trained model is always going to be hampered by this bias - predictions are only going to be accurate for the individuals represented in the dataset. A solution to this could be to incorporate more datasets in the training model, to increase its diversity and generalization (and therefore its impartiality). Some candidate datasets for this step are available at [http://www.face-rec.org/databases/](http://www.face-rec.org/databases/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The final element to consider is the large class imbalance in the whole dataset. Up-sampling and down-sampling can be effective techniques when we have a small number of classes, or the class imbalance is small, but when the largest category has 500 times more images than the smallest then smarter tools are needed. This problem was considered in detail by the [Facebook AI Research Team](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf), who used focal loss (a weighted application of cross-entropy loss) to allocate \"attention\" to incorrect inferences. Exploring this loss function would be vital in obtaining an optimal model on the whole dataset.\n"
